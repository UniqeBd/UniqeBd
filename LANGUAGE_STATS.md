# Language Statistics Auto-Update

This repository contains an **enhanced automated system** that immediately detects new repositories and updates both the language usage statistics and the "Languages and Tools" section in the README.md file.

## üÜï Latest Updates & Fixes

- ‚úÖ **Fixed workflow failures**: Resolved path issues that caused daily job failures
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- ‚úÖ **Robust error handling**: Added retry logic and better error messages
- ‚úÖ **Improved badge generation**: Fixed logo slugs and URL encoding for special characters
- ‚úÖ **Configurable React detection**: Set `REACT_JS_ALLOCATION_PERCENT` (default: 0 = disabled)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced framework detection**: Uses repository topics for better accuracy
- ‚úÖ **HTML marker-based updates**: More reliable README section replacement

## ‚ú® Immediate Language Detection Features

The system now provides **immediate detection** when you create new repositories and push projects:

- üöÄ **Daily Automatic Updates**: Runs every day for faster detection
- üÜï **New Repository Detection**: Automatically highlights recently created repositories  
- ‚ö° **Cross-Repository Triggers**: Other repositories can trigger immediate updates
- üìä **Real-time Language Analysis**: Updates progress bars as soon as new languages are detected
- üéØ **Smart Framework Detection**: Instantly recognizes frameworks and tools in new projects

## How it works

1. **Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow**: The `.github/workflows/update-language-stats.yml` workflow triggers:
   - **Daily at 00:00 UTC** for immediate detection of new repositories
   - When **any code is pushed** to the main branch
   - Via **repository_dispatch** events from other repositories
   - Manually via workflow dispatch

2. **Enhanced Language Analysis Script**: The `scripts/update_language_stats.py` script:
   - Fetches all public repositories sorted by most recently updated
   - **Detects repositories created within the last 30 days**
   - Analyzes language usage across all repositories (excluding forks)
   - Calculates percentage distribution of languages by bytes
   - Detects frameworks and tools based on repository analysis
   - Updates both the "Most Used Languages" table and "Languages and Tools" section in README.md
   - **Provides detailed logging** showing which new repositories were detected
   - Commits changes if statistics have changed

## üéØ Quick Setup for New Repositories

### Method 1: Automatic Detection (Recommended)
- The system runs **daily** and will detect new repositories within 24 hours
- New repositories are automatically highlighted in the logs with üÜï indicators
- No manual intervention required

### Method 2: Manual Trigger (Instant)
1. Go to your profile repository ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí "Update Language Statistics"
2. Click "Run workflow" to trigger immediate update
3. New languages and repositories will be detected within minutes

### Method 3: Cross-Repository Automation (Advanced)
Set up other repositories to automatically trigger updates when you push code:

1. Run the setup helper:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_repo_webhook.py
   ```

2. Copy the generated action file to your other repositories:
   ```
   .github/workflows/trigger-language-stats.yml
   ```

3. Add a `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret with repo access

4. Now pushes to any configured repository will trigger immediate language stats updates!

## üîß Local Development

For local testing and development:

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   export GITHUB_USERNAME=UniqeBd
   # Optional: Enable React detection (percentage of JS to convert to React)
   export REACT_JS_ALLOCATION_PERCENT=60
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/update_language_stats.py
   ```

## Configuration Options

- `REACT_JS_ALLOCATION_PERCENT`: Percentage of JavaScript to convert to React in detected React projects (default: 0 = disabled)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub personal access token
- `GITHUB_USERNAME`: Your GitHub username
- `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`: Workspace directory (auto-detected in CI)

## Features

- **Automatic Updates**: No manual intervention needed when adding new repositories
- **Dynamic Languages and Tools**: The "Languages and Tools" section now shows images based on actual repository data
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect GitHub API rate limits
- **Language Colors**: Maintains consistent badge colors for popular languages
- **React Detection**: Automatically detects React projects and shows React as a separate language
- **Framework Detection**: Intelligently detects frameworks like Flutter, React, Node.js, Android Studio based on repository names and descriptions
- **Top Languages**: Shows top languages by percentage in the statistics table
- **Smart Tool Detection**: Only shows frameworks and tools that are actually used in repositories
- **Fork Exclusion**: Excludes forked repositories from statistics
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and rate limits

## Sections Updated

### üõ†Ô∏è Languages and Tools
- **Programming Languages**: Dynamically generated based on actual language usage from repositories
- **Frameworks & Tools**: Automatically detects and displays only frameworks/tools actually used
- **Ordered by Usage**: Languages appear in order of usage frequency
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintains the same badge style while adding dynamic functionality

### üìä Most Used Languages
- **Percentage Table**: Shows detailed breakdown with percentages and progress bars
- **Top 10 Display**: Limits to most relevant languages
- **Color-Coded**: Each language has its distinctive color

## Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the language statistics update by:
1. Going to the Actions tab in your repository
2. Selecting "Update Language Statistics" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

## Customization

### Adding New Language Colors

Edit the `language_colors` dictionary in `scripts/update_language_stats.py`:

```python
self.language_colors = {
    'NewLanguage': 'COLOR_HEX',
    'React': '61DAFB',        # React projects
    'JSX': '61DAFB',          # JSX files
    # ... existing colors
}
```

### Adding New Framework Detection

Edit the `detect_frameworks_and_tools()` method to add new framework detection:

```python
# Add new framework detection logic
if 'newframework' in repo_name or 'newframework' in description:
    detected['NewFramework'] = True
```

### Changing Update Frequency

Modify the cron schedule in `.github/workflows/update-language-stats.yml`:

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sundays at 00:00 UTC
```

## Requirements

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
- `requests` Python package: Installed automatically in workflow

The system is fully automated and requires no maintenance once set up.
